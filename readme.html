    <div class="trading-description">
      The word "Trading" is an umbrella term for the exchange of goods at point in time. Trading uses
      These markets you will be capitalizing off of refer to the facilitatation an the exchange of goods.
        The same way someone is willing to buy a fruit at a price is the same way a person is willing to buy a 
        stock or commodoty like a car. Once you start to associate a demand with every particular thing in life
        trading becomes easier. People change their mind about how much they are willing to pay for things all
        the time, this is called demand. Every stock, car, piece of technology, or even a gold brick will always have demand
        for it at any given time and trading is all about knowing when its likey for demand of a product to go up or go down
        given the variety of factors related to the underlaying product at the time.

        For example if a beyblade comerial starts to get kids interested in buying their toys, the demand
        for beyblades will go up. Now image only 100 beyblades are released by the company who
        makes them, if 100 people buy up all the beyblades priced at $10, the first person who doesnt want 
        their beyblade anymore can sell it for $11. This facilitation of scare goods is what makes markets
        like Bitcoin and the S&P500 "tradeable". The things we will be "trading" are scare, which allows us to 
        capitilize on the fluctuations in demand, completly online at the comfort of a nice chair.
