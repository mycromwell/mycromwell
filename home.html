    <div class="trading-description">
    The word "trading" is an umbrella term for the exchange of goods at a specific point in time. The markets you will be capitalizing on facilitate the exchange of these goods.
    The same way someone is willing to buy a fruit at a certain price is the same way a person is willing to buy a stock or a commodity, like a car. Once you start to associate 
      demand with every particular thing in life, trading becomes easier. People change their minds all the time about how much they are willing to pay for things; this is called 
      demand. Every stock, car, piece of technology, or even a gold brick will always have a demand for it at any given time. Trading is all about knowing when the demand for a 
      product is likely to go up or down, given a variety of factors related to the underlying product at that time.
    For example, if a Beyblade commercial gets kids interested in buying their toys, the demand for Beyblades will go up. Now, imagine only 100 Beyblades
      are released by the company that makes them. If 100 people buy up all the Beyblades priced at $10, the first person who no longer wants their Beyblade can sell it for $11. 
      This facilitation of scarce goods is what makes markets like Bitcoin and the S&P 500 "tradeable." The things we will be "trading" are scarce, which allows us to capitalize 
      on the fluctuations in demand completely online from the comfort of a nice chair.
